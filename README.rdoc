Terrarium Monitor Website

HTML CSS and JS display real time data being delivered throug the Pusher
realtime data service.

Data is collected by sersors being read by an arduino running "dataLogger.ino".
This arduino then sends the sensor data over serial to a ruby script
"serial.rb". Serial.rb takes the serial data and feeds data to a Pusher server,
which updates data in real time to a server. Using a JS push client, live
updates to the webpage are triggered.
